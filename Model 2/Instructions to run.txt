Steps to run Model 1:

1. Migrate to the 'Model 2' folder through Terminal or command line
2. First run 'python t1.py'. This will create and train the Naives Bayes classifier
3. Then run 'python t2.py'. This will start a stream of tweets, and classify each tweet as negative or positive, denoting them as 'neg' or 'pos' respectively and store it in a file in same directory
4. Then run 'python plot2.py' in order to visualize the live streams sentiment, this will read all the 'pos' and 'neg' in the file created in the previous step.
